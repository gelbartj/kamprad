"You can do so much in 10 minutes' time. Ten minutes, once gone, are gone for good. Divide your life into 10-minute units and sacrifice as few of them as possible in meaningless activity."
-Ingvar Kamprad, founder of IKEA

Inspired by Ingvar Kamprad's quote above, I created Kamprad.xyz, a productivity tool designed to help users make the most of their days, one 10-minute block at a time. Users simply flip an on/off switch to indicate whether they are working or not, and the site will keep track of their productivity in 10-minute blocks.
    
This project was my first React app (hence the single huge file with all components in it, which I've since learned from...) and my first time using Google Firebase. It is installable as a PWA and has live synchronization capabilities through Firebase.
